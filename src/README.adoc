## Shell-Scripts

[cols="0%,100%"]
|===
|changelog_set.sh | 
Opens a copy of the current changelog file in your operating systems default text editor. You can make your edits, save and close, and then accept the input prompt in the script to update the changelog file.
|copy_reaperthemezip.sh | 
Copies created *ReaperThemeZip* files to the reaper instance *ColorThemes* folder
|themes_make_and_copy.sh | 
Combination of *themes_make.sh* and *copy_reaperthemezip.sh*, reducing those action to one call
|themes_make.sh | 
Creates all the themes using the exising assets. Asks if previous assets shall be deleted. Doing so will delay the process, but absolutely assure to include only the recent assets
|unpack_themes.sh | 
Will extract the contents of the main *ReaperThemeZip* files into the reaper *ColorThemes* folder. Works only if there are no ReaperThemeZip files in the ColorThemes folder in the first place. Allows a more direct and faster way of experimenting with the assets.
|version_set.sh | 
Simple prompt that allows the user to change the contents of the *version* file. *Input an integer*, since the script will automatically add the *"v"* to the tag. Input nothing will leave the current version unchanged.
