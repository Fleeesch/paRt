# paRt - Source - Theme

Contains all the files and tools to create ReaperTheme files.

NOTE: There will be *ReaperTheme* files in this folder once a theme creation process is initialized. Those will be overwritten everytime a complete theme creation process is started, so editing them is not advisable.

## Colors

|===

## Scripts

## Header Files

Header files starting with a *"hdr_"* that only contain comment lines. They're only for informal purposes. *During the theme creation those files are created automatically, so editing them won't matter.*

## Image Files

Files starting with a "*img_*" that simply contain the relative path to the assets for each theme.

## Font File

Font definitions used universally across all themes.

## Dark - Windows Keys

The *win_dark_keys.txt* file contains a set of keys that will be used during the theme creation process to construct the *ReaperTheme* file for the *Dark - Windows Theme*. During the theme creation process, the *clr_dark.txt* file will be used as a blueprint for the *Dark - Windows Theme* and all the keys with their values listed in the *win_dark_keys.txt* will be grabbed from the *clr_light.txt* file and merged into the blueprint. The result will be saved in the *clr_dark_win.txt* file.
