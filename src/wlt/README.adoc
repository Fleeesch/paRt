# paRt - Source - Walter

Contains all the files required to dynamically generate the *rtconfig.txt* file per theme.

## Colors

## Header Files

Header files starting with a *"hdr_"* that only contain comment lines. They're only for informal purposes. *During the theme creation those files are created automatically, so editing them won't matter.* +

The *version_snippet* file is also automatically generated, no need to edit it.

## rtconfig.txt

The main file containing all the WALTER theming data. References information found in the *'clr_...'* files. 

The theming uses the dimension array supported by WALTER, allowing to create short variable array containing up to 8 entries. This limit is represented in the Zoom level count: There are exactly 8 zoom levels, and for each element the value is extracted using an index number representing the zoom level.

[source,language]
----
;This is a definition of the the MCP knob dimensions, containing all zoom levels:
*set mcp.knob [18 23 27 32 36 41 45 54]*

;If one wants to get the MCP knob size for zoom level 150, the index number 2 is used to access it:
*set idx 2*
*set mcp.pan  [0 0 mcp.knob{idx} mcp.knob{idx}]*
----

NOTE: The positions and dimensions of elements are most of the time calculated using a pointer system. The pointer is incremented and set at various places, and in order to consider hidden elements, the pointer calculations can be _"frozen"_. This is all quite cumbersome and compilacted and not necessarily meant to be manipulated.

## Scale Files

The scale files contain the DPI-related drawing information. They are integral to the theme drawing process since they have the WALTER Macros that trigger the drawing processes.

|===
|scale_{size} | Single-size scaling, forcing Reaper to use a specific DPI scaling factor
|scale_omni | Scaling for all supported zoom levels, using WALTER's DPI translation capabilities
