## Toolbar Icon Creation Process

Toolbar icons in Reaper can be separated into _'normal'_ icons and icons introduced in Reaper V6. For the sake of keeping things short conventional icons are called *_'V3'_* icons here.

V3 Icons::
V3 toolbar icons simply use a combination of the *'toolbar_blank.png'* with a toolbar icon layered over it. Reaper does this automatically. Those third sprite in the sheet is used for the activate toggle state, if there is any.

V6 Icons::
Toolbar Icons introduced in Reaper V6 are icons that either come as a single instance for oneshot click actions or as a pair of two sprite-sheets with the filename endings *"..._off.png"* or *"..._on.png"*, representing their states. There's a list of V6 icons in the *"ico/sort_v6_files.sh.list"* file discovered through reverse engineering.

NOTE: V6 Toolbar Icons won't be automatically merged with the *"toolbar_blank.png"* sprite-sheet during runtime, meaning by default their background will be transparent. The *out_make.sh* in the toolbar folder will take care of adding the background to those images so that they become indistinguishable from conventional toolbar icons.
