NOTE: The original *toolbar_add.png* icon seems to have a render-failure, some instances came with a white background without transparency. This has been fixed manually for this set of original icons.

## Scripts

[cols="0%,100%"]
|===
|make_icons.sh|Creates rendered icons that for the dark and light themes. V3 icons follow a pattern of *bright-bright-dark*, same goes for many V6 icons. The only exception are on-state V6 icons, those follow the inverted pattern *dark-dark-bright*. Always calls *sort_v6_files.sh* before creating the icon assets.
|sort_v6_files.sh|Sorts the files in the */original* folder, separating them into v3 and v6 icons. Before the sorting process all icons will be treaded as a union, so merging the folders the folders manually won't be necessary.
