# paRt - Source - Gfx

Contains all the assets and the shell-script tools used to create usuable sprite-sheets.

## Affinity Project Structures

The source graphics are created using Affinity Designer. In order to reduce manual labor, the *afdesign* files are often nested, meaning the contents of one *afdesign* file are used in another one. Affinity designer allows a file to be split into separate *Artboards*, when placing an *afdesign* into another, one can pick a specific Artboard to be used.

Affinity Designer is quite stubborn when confronted with path changes, so an initial openining of an *afdesign* file placed in a new path will likely result in a ressource-not-found Error. One has to use trial-and-error methods to see if Affinity Designer is capable of finding the original links to the source asseets files.

The dependencies of each *afdesign* file is listed within the sub-directories *README.adoc* file, under the section *_Depdency-Tree_*. The trees can be read like that:

****
* file a
** file a.b -> depends on file a
*** file a.c -> depends on file a.b -> *last file in the dependency chain, can be rendered*
* file b -> *no dependencies, can be rendered*
* file c -> ...

|ats | Contains the assets in form of single sprites, organized with the pattern */{theme}/{size}/{element}.png*

## Scripts

[cols="0%,100%"]
|===
|make_all_sprites.sh | Creates all the sprite-sheets from the existing assets. *Takes a huge amount of time, use with caution.*
|spritesheet_maker.sh | Function-Container for creating sprite-sheets. Called by shell scripts in the sub-directories using commmand-line arugments.

## Spritesheet-Maker

Every sub-directory has at least one file-pair consisting of a *"..._make.sh"* and a *"..._make.sh.list"* file.

The *".sh"* file goes through the *".sh.list"* file line by line, calling functions of the *spritesheet_maker.sh* using a bunch of command-line arguments. Since there many variations of sprite-sheets with individual needs, this allows one to dynamically create spirte-sheets using overlays, shortcuts, or whatever additional functionality that comes to mind. As long as the function exists within the *spritesheet_maker.sh*, it can be addressed with a line in a *".sh.list"* file. Commenting out lines using a *"#"* works, too.

NOTE: The creation of the sprite-sheets requires some time, and very often only a selection of the sprite-sheets are required to be created. Spreading everything across multiple script files speeds up the developement process. Having only one *.sh* and *.sh.list* file pair will work, too.
