# paRt - Example Project

This is an example project used for demonstrating the themes capabilities, containing a large amount of tracks and most of the elements Reaper provides from the get-go. It also acts as a source for screenshots.

The project should be able to run out of the box on a fresh install of Reaper. The missing plugins are provided in the *effects* folder and should load automatically when opening the project.
