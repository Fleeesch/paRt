I tear
MCs apart till they look like ready-to-eat Sauerkraut
shootin lightening from my fingers causing onstage power outs
others are a traveling the world, fuckin around like hoppelhasen
but me I'm stayin true digging crates and droppin bars man
my drum machine don't need any system update
fingers around the capsule, DJs spinning a dubplate
you're DAW ain't shit, I'm recording on tape when I'm making
underground hits, studio's in the basement
Spätzle, Spätzle, Nudelsuppe, Kuchenboden
all my lyrics are regarded as true and holy
consering styles like Tupperware conserves food
krauts come to me telling me every one of my verse's gut
lyrics fresher than Sonntagsbrötchen
haters gonna flee when they hear the thunder rödeln
Punkt, Punkt, Komma, Strich - Listen man your songs are shit
Listen to this solo - it's on fire - gives you Sonnenstich
