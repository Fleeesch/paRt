Greetings,

bought myself some new technology. Apparently, they’re still adding more pixels to displays, so I needed something that works with the old and the new. Bit the bullet and created a theme from scratch. Wouldn’t recommend it, you people better go catch some fresh air.

I wanted to make sure that this theme can be used by others, so I tried incorporating all the theme-affecting settings that come with Reaper from the get-go. Nonetheless, this theme heavily reflects my subjective view on what a theme should look like, which, of course, isn’t ideal for everyone.

Since I needed something to take some usuable screenshots with, here’s a project that I’ve made exclusively for this theme:

[b][url=https://github.com/Fleeesch/paRt/tree/main/test/example%20project]Example Project[/url][/b]
[url=https://fleeesch.github.io/res/part/audio/test/part_example-project_82_Dub_Sum.mp3]listen[/url]

Language is german, so it’s all Kraut Klöße Suppennudeln in there.

Feel free to post any bugs you’ve found. It’s gonna take me some time to respond, but I’m glad to help.

[i]Thanks to [b]lampshade[/b] and [b]Janne83[/b], your themes served me well over the years!
And of course, everyone here that's contributing.[/i]
