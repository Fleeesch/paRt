# paRt - plain adapting Reaper Theme

## About

paRt is a Reaper theme that prioritizes functionality over looks. It focusses highly on compatibility between different generations of displays.

## User Guide

Detailed instructions on how to implement and use paRt are available here:

*link:doc/userguide/part_userguide.adoc[paRt user guide]*

## Dependencies

NOTE: The whole theme creation process has been done entirely in Windows 10 (22H2). Using any other operating system is very likely going to require workarounds that need to be figured out.

### Software

KnobMan::
Tool for creating knob sprite-sheets. Used for all the knob-stacks and their overlays. *Seems to written in Java, so cross-OS-compatibility is a possibility.*
*link:https://www.g200kg.com/jp/software/knobman.html[Get it here]*

AffinityDesigner V2.1.1::
Vector-graphics editor used for creating all the assets from scratch. Is very likely going to give users trouble since most of them are co-dependent and Affinity Designer doesn't seem to support relative paths. *Only available on Windows and MacOS.*

ImageMagick::
Used for creating sprite-sheets out of existing assets. Finalizes the bitmap-creation process by combination several different assets into one usuable sprite-sheet, including the pink-frame border and overlay/shadow graphics.

### Bash Scripts

* *Linux*
** Should run out of the box. The tools used in the shell scripts are quite basic.
* *MacOS*
** No experience, might be as compatible as Linux since it's Unix based.
* *Windows*
** Can be done using WSL or Git Bash. *The following tools need to be added manually to Git Bash in order to ensure the functionality of the shell scripts*
*** rsync
*** zip

### reapack-index
*update_reapack.sh* offers an optional action that requires *link:https://github.com/cfillion/reapack-index[reapack-index]*, its depedencies are also required to make everything work. If you're on Windows you might want to try *WSL*.
