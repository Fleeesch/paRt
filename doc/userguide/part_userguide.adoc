=== Theme File Versions

Each **.ReaperThemeZip* color theme of paRt is a separate package containing a full set of theme assets. There are different versions of paRt mainly for more specific use cases.

==== Default Theme Files

Contains 8 asset-sets of one color scheme required for covering their respective zoom level. The theme works on multiple displays with different DPI settings.

==== Split Theme Files

Single-zoom-factor version of a color theme of paRt. +

Contains only one asset of a color theme set covering exactly one specific zoom level. There are some minor tweaks that result in more clarity when using them (item buttons are sharper, for example). 

The size of split themes is drastically reduced, resulting in faster loading times.

[NOTE]
Split versions aren't part of the ReaPack Content and need to be downloaded separately from the GitHub releases page

[NOTE]
You can use split theme files to overwrite the DPI drawing level, but it might result in some conflicts when your OS scaling differs


=== Color Schemes

There are 3 color schemes available:

==== Dark

Default color scheme.

==== Dark (Windows)

A variation of the Dark color schemes that compensates for Windows lack of Dark Mode support for Win32 Apps (that includes Reaper).

The floating windows that allow theming come with a light background and their interactive elements are mostly in a lighter shade, allowing them to better blend with Windows GUI elements.

==== Light

Brighter variation of the default dark color schemes.

== Installation

=== Using ReaPack

If you want to get paRt by using Reapers unofficial package manager add this url to your repository list:

{gitrepo}


Reapack will download the most recent ReaperThemeZip files of all skins. The theme variation

=== Manually downloaded Github-Release

You can download each version of paRt individually from the {gitrelease}[Github-repository release page].

Unpack the archive and move the included **.ReaperThemeZip* file to the ColorThemes folder of your Reaper installation.

The location of the ColorThemes folder varies depending on your Operating System. If you want to know where it is, open Reaper and unter the top menu register 'Options' you will find the option to *'Show REAPER ressource path in explorer/finder'*.

[NOTE]
On a portable install of Reaper the ColorThemes folder will be located in the program folder of Reaper.

=== Fonts

paRt uses the Carlito font, an opensource font under the GNU license. The font is included in every release of paRt and needs to be installed for optimal compatibility. You can use standard fonts, it just will look weird because the sizing will be slightly off.

The installation of the font varies depending on the Operating System you use.

Windows::
Right click the *.tff* file and choose *'Install Font'*.
MacOS::
Double-click on the *.tff* in finder and click Install in the font preview that opens.
Linux::
Double-click on the *.tff* file and open the font viewer. There should be an Install button in the top right corner. Click that one. Optionally compile a new kernel.

=== Scripts

Scripts are automatically installed and integrated when downloading paRt using Reapack. If you manually install the scripts from a GitHub release page, integrate them like any other script in Reaper.

[WARNING]
Keep the folder structure intact, the scripts are depending on a library file

== Configuration

=== Theme Adjustments

Custom settings for the theme are entirely done using the official Reaper Theme Adjuster. This is an implementation that happened on purpose to ensure maximum compatibility with a default Reaper installation.

==== MCP Width / Layout

image:res/theme-adj/theme-adj_mcp_width.png[]

Changes the layout of the MCP. The layouts are arranged by width, so the first layout is a thin meter strip while the last layout gives you the largest meter. All tracks share the same layout all the time.

[%autowidth,frame=none, grid=none]

==== MCP All-Faders Mode

image:res/theme-adj/theme-adj_mcp_fadermode.png[]

Alternates between the conventional volume fader and pan knob configuration and an all-vertical-faders layout. The all-fader layout is helpful if you're working with control surfaces and prefer to use the motorized faders exclusively. That way you don't have to translate the linear motion of a motorized fader to pan knob and vice versa.

Depending on the value you can have this layout set exclusively for the Master MCP track or just the ordinary tracks.

[%autowidth, cols="^.^,.^,^.^",frame=none, grid=none]

*3 -* all tracks |image:res/settings/track_faders_on.png[]
|===

==== MCP Faders Horizontal

image:res/theme-adj/theme-adj_mcp_faders_horz.png[]

This arranges the pan/width faders in a horizontal way. The setting gets only applied for tracks that have the All-Faders layout applied to them. The first MCP layout (channel strip) ignores this setting since there's just not enough space available.

==== MCP Fader Split / MCP Master Fader Split

image:res/theme-adj/theme-adj_mcp_faders_split.png[]
image:res/theme-adj/theme-adj_mcp_faders_mst_split.png[]

This setting is only used when an All-Faders layout is applied without the horizontal layout.

Use this setting to change the amount of space for the volume fader, the higher the value the less space the volume fader gets. The space is calculated dynamically. The Master track has its separate adjustment.

[NOTE]
Be aware that the faders are converted to knobs if there's not enough space.

==== MCP Sidebar on FX Embed

image:res/theme-adj/theme-adj_mcp_sidebar_embed.png[]

Dynamically creates a sidebar layout for the MCP tracks if there is an embedded FX available on the track.

The Master track is excluded from this setting since there are some issues with dynamically resizing the Master MCP track that couldn't be resolved.

[NOTE]
If a track already uses a sidebar layout this setting is going to overwrite the sidebar width, unless the width in this setting is set to be less.

==== MCP FX Panel / MCP Master FX Panel

image:res/theme-adj/theme-adj_mcp_fx.png[]
image:res/theme-adj/theme-adj_mcp_mst_fx.png[]

Changes the size, positioning and behaviour of the MCP FX Panel. The Master track is excluded from this setting

[NOTE]
When setting a fixed height using values 1-99, small heights are only possible by activating send and parameter grouping in the mixer settings

==== TCP Layout

image:res/theme-adj/theme-adj_tcp_trim.png[]

Adjustment for trimming the layout of the TCP. This is useful if you work with a static setup where the mixer is always visible and you want to maximize the arrangement-area.
